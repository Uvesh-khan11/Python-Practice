Here are some Python practice questions to help you build your logic:

### 1. **Sum of Digits**
   Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and returns the sum of its digits.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `1234`
   - Output: `10` (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

### 2. **Check for Prime Number**
   Write a program that checks whether a given number is prime or not.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `29`
   - Output: `Prime`

### 3. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   Write a program to generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, where `n` is an input from the user.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Output: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3`

### 4. **Palindrome Checker**
   Write a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

   **Example:**
   - Input: `"radar"`
   - Output: `True`

### 5. **Factorial Calculation**
   Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Output: `120` (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)

### 6. **Count Vowels in a String**
   Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `"hello"`
   - Output: `2`

### 7. **Find the Largest Number**
   Write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest of the three.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `10, 20, 30`
   - Output: `30`

### 8. **Reverse a String**
   Write a program that reverses a given string.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `"Python"`
   - Output: `"nohtyP"`

### 9. **Find Even and Odd Numbers**
   Write a program that takes a list of numbers and separates them into even and odd numbers.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Output: `Even: [2, 4], Odd: [1, 3, 5]`

### 10. **Multiplication Table**
   Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Output:
     ```
     5 x 1 = 5
     5 x 2 = 10
     ...
     5 x 10 = 50
     ```
